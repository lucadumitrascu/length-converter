<h2>How it works?</h2>
<h3>Each converter class has its own functionalities (change value, show history, conversion between units, close converter). These are accessible by the user through a do-while statement. <br>
<br>
These classes are sharing together an <strong><i>abstract class</i></strong> using <strong><i>inheritance</i></strong> in order to avoid code duplication and to improve modularity. <br>
<br>
With another class called ProgramController it was possible to connect all the converters through a <strong><i>composition relation</i></strong>. <br></h3>
